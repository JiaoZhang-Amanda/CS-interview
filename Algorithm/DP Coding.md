<summary>337. Combination Sum IV </summary>
Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

Example:

nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.

<summary>474. Ones and Zeroes</summary>
In the computer world, use restricted resource you have to generate maximum benefit is what we always want to pursue.

For now, suppose you are a dominator of m 0s and n 1s respectively. On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s.

Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m 0s and n 1s. Each 0 and 1 can be used at most once.

Input: Array = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"}, m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4

Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are “10,”0001”,”1”,”0”

<summary>465. Optimal Account Balancing </summary>
A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].

Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.
Input:
[[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]

Output:
2

<summary>276.  Paint Fence</summary>
There is a fence with n posts, each post can be painted with one of the k colors.

You have to paint all the posts such that no more than two adjacent fence posts have the same color.

Return the total number of ways you can paint the fence.

Note:
n and k are non-negative integers.

<summary>656. Coin Path</summary>
Given an array A (index starts at 1) consisting of N integers: A1, A2, ..., AN and an integer B. The integer B denotes that from any place (suppose the index is i) in the array A, you can jump to any one of the place in the array A indexed i+1, i+2, …, i+B if this place can be jumped to. Also, if you step on the index i, you have to pay Ai coins. If Ai is -1, it means you can’t jump to the place indexed i in the array.

Now, you start from the place indexed 1 in the array A, and your aim is to reach the place indexed N using the minimum coins. You need to return the path of indexes (starting from 1 to N) in the array you should take to get to the place indexed N using minimum coins.

If there are multiple paths with the same cost, return the lexicographically smallest such path.

If it's not possible to reach the place indexed N then you need to return an empty array.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,4,-1,2], 2
Output: [1,3,5]

<summary>727. Minimum Window Subsequence </summary>
Given strings S and T, find the minimum (contiguous) substring W of S, so that T is a subsequence of W.

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "". If there are multiple such minimum-length windows, return the one with the left-most starting index.

Example 1:

Input: 
S = "abcdebdde", T = "bde"
Output: "bcde"
Explanation: 
"bcde" is the answer because it occurs before "bdde" which has the same length.
"deb" is not a smaller window because the elements of T in the window must occur in order.

<summary>351. Android Unlock Patterns</summary>
Given an Android 3x3 key lock screen and two integers m and n, where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 9, count the total number of unlock patterns of the Android lock screen, which consist of minimum of m keys and maximum n keys.

Rules for a valid pattern:

Each pattern must connect at least m keys and at most n keys.
All the keys must be distinct.
If the line connecting two consecutive keys in the pattern passes through any other keys, the other keys must have previously selected in the pattern. No jumps through non selected key is allowed.
The order of keys used matters.

<summary>361. Bomb Enemy </summary>
Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall 'W', an enemy 'E' or empty '0' (the number zero), return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb.
The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it hits the wall since the wall is too strong to be destroyed.
Note that you can only put the bomb at an empty cell.

Example:
For the given grid

0 E 0 0
E 0 W E
0 E 0 0

return 3. (Placing a bomb at (1,1) kills 3 enemies)

<summary>471. Encode String with Shortest Length</summary>
Given a non-empty string, encode the string such that its encoded length is the shortest.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times.

Note:
k will be a positive integer and encoded string will not be empty or have extra space.
You may assume that the input string contains only lowercase English letters. The string's length is at most 160.
If an encoding process does not make the string shorter, then do not encode it. If there are several solutions, return any of them is fine.
Example 1:

Input: "aaa"
Output: "aaa"
Explanation: There is no way to encode it such that it is shorter than the input string, so we do not encode it.
Example 2:

Input: "aaaaa"
Output: "5[a]"
Explanation: "5[a]" is shorter than "aaaaa" by 1 character.

<summary>10. Regular Expression Matching</summary>
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.

'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Note:

s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.
Example 1:

Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

<summary>418. Sentence Screen Fitting </summary>
Given a rows x cols screen and a sentence represented by a list of non-empty words, find how many times the given sentence can be fitted on the screen.

Note:
A word cannot be split into two lines.
The order of words in the sentence must remain unchanged.
Two consecutive words in a line must be separated by a single space.
Total words in the sentence won’t exceed 100.
Length of each word is greater than 0 and won’t exceed 10.
1 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 20,000.

Example 1:
Input:
rows = 2, cols = 8, sentence = ["hello", "world"]
Output: 
1
Explanation:
hello---
world---
The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.

<summary>568. Maximum Vacation Days</summary>
LeetCode wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among N cities to collect algorithm problems. But all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.

Rules and restrictions:

You can only travel among N cities, represented by indexes from 0 to N-1. Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday.
The cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as a N*N matrix (not necessary symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status from the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] = 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. Also, flights[i][i] = 0 for all i.
You totally have K weeks (each week has 7 days) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time.
For each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an N*K matrix called days representing this relationship. For the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city i in the week j.
 

You're given the flights matrix and days matrix, and you need to output the maximum vacation days you could take during K weeks.

Example 1:

Input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
Ans = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. 

One of the best strategies is:
1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day. 
(Although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities since it is Monday.) 
2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 3 days and work 4 days.
3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days.

<summary>312. Burst Balloons </summary>
Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.

Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

Note:

You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.
0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100
Example:

Input: [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167 
Explanation: nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  --> []
             coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167

<summary>486. Predict the Winner    </summary>
Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.

Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 5, 2]
Output: False
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.
