<summary>246. Strobogrammatic Number</summary>
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented as a string.

Example 1:

Input:  "69"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input:  "88"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input:  "962"
Output: false

<summary>247. Strobogrammatic Number II</summary>
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length = n.

For example,
Given n = 2, return ["11","69","88","96"].

Hint:

Try to use recursion and notice that it should recurse with n - 2 instead of n - 1.

<summary>279. Perfect Squares</summary>
Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

Example 1:

Input: n = 12
Output: 3 
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

<details>
<summary>231. Power of Two</summary>
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: true 
Explanation: 20 = 1
Example 2:

Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
</details>

<details>
<summary>326. Power of Three</summary>
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.

Example 1:

Input: 27
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: 0
Output: false

<summary>50. Pow(x, n)</summary>
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (xn).

Example 1:

Input: 2.00000, 10
Output: 1024.00000
Example 2:

Input: 2.10000, 3
Output: 9.26100
Example 3:

Input: 2.00000, -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25

<summary>400. Nth Digit</summary>
Find the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...

Note:
n is positive and will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (n < 231).

Example 1:

Input:
3

Output:
3
Example 2:

Input:
11

Output:
0

Explanation:
The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.

<summary>397. Integer Replacement </summary>
Given a positive integer n and you can do operations as follow:

If n is even, replace n with n/2.
If n is odd, you can replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
What is the minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1?

Example 1:

Input:
8

Output:
3

Explanation:
8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

<summary>401. Binary Watch</summary>
A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).

Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

<summary>224. Basic Calculator</summary>
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string may contain open ( and closing parentheses ), the plus + or minus sign -, non-negative integers and empty spaces .

Example 1:

Input: "1 + 1"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3

<summary>393. UTF-8 Validation</summary>
A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

For 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode code.
For n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all one's, the n+1 bit is 0, followed by n-1 bytes with most significant 2 bits being 10.
This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

   Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
      (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)
   --------------------+---------------------------------------------
   0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx
   0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0000 0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a valid utf-8 encoding.
