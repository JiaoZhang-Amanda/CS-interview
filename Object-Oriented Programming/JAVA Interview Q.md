## JAVA Basic Concept
### OOP
* **Inheritance**: It lets programmers create new classes that share some of the attributes of existing classes. 
* **Poymorphism**: uses those methods to perform different tasks when you inherit attributes and methods from another class. method overloading & method overriding.
    * **Overloading** occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.
    * **Overriding** means having two methods with the same method name and parameters (i.e., method signature). One of the methods is in the parent class and the other is in the child class. Overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided its parent class.
* **Encapsulation**: to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:
    * declare class variables/attributes as private
    * provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable
* **Abstraction**: Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
    Abstraction can be achieved with either **abstract classes** or **interfaces**
#### 2) What is data encapsulation and whatâ€™s its significance?
**Encapsulation** is a concept in Object Oriented Programming for combining properties and methods in a single unit. Encapsulation helps programmers to follow a modular approach for software development as each object has its own set of methods and variables and serves its functions independent of other objects. Encapsulation also serves data hiding purpose.
